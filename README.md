# aiobgp

A Python BGP client utilising asyncio

## Introduction

The `aiobgp` library allows for programmatic manipulation of networks using the BGP protocol by implementing
an AsyncIO ServerProtocol class.

This allows for arbitrary programmatic learning and manipulation of a router's RIB table.  The possibilities
are endless.

This library assumes basic knowledge of the BGP4 protocol.  For details, read [RFC 1771](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1771).
